           <h5>Hash</h5>

                <li>8 Ounces extra-firm tofu</li>
                <li>1-2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1/4 red onion</li>
                <li>1/2 red pepper</li>
                <li>2 cups kale</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Sauce</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp tumeric</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>For Serving</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Salsa</li>
                <li>Cilantro</li>
                <li>Hot Sauce</li>
                <Li>Breakfast Potatoes</Li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat tofu dry and roll in a clean, absorbent towel with something heavy on top, such as a cast-iron skillet, for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>While tofu is draining, prepare sauce by adding dry spices to a small bowl and adding enough water to make a pourable sauce. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Prep veggies and warm a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add olive oil and the onion and red pepper. Season with a pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Cook until softened for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add kale, season with a bit more salt and pepper, and cover to steam for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, unwrap tofu and use a fork to crumble into bite-sized pieces.</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to move the veggies to one side of the pan and add tofu. Sauté for 2 minutes, then add sauce, pouring it mostly over the tofu and a little over the veggies. Stir immediately, evenly distributing the sauce. Cook for another 5-7 minutes until tofu is slightly browned.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately with the breakfast potatoes, toast, or fruit. I like to add more flavor with salsa, hot sauce, and/or fresh cilantro. Alternatively, freeze for up to 1 month and reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave.</li>
