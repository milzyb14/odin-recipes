# odin-recipes
My first html project
This project is a basic html webpage with my favorite recipes! I love to cook and I have fell into loving coding as much as I do cooking. With this project I will showcase my basic html skills I have learned while following the odin project and working on my meta front end dev certification. Stay tuned to see more!
